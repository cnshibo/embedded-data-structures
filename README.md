In many microcontroller projects, using the C++ standard library may be considered a luxury due to the resource-constrained environments typically found in microcontrollers, including limited memory and processing capabilities. The C++ standard library is often large and requires dynamic memory allocation. However, C++ library functions can provide us with a lot of convenience. To balance these factors, we generally use data structures based on static memory. This repository contains some commonly used data structures, hoping you'll find them useful.
